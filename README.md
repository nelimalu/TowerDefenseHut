Submission for the MCPT Game Dev "Create Your Own Tower" challenge

Written by Luka Jovanovic

## Hut Tower
The challenge description was to make the "coolest" tower.
My idea was to make a tower, which does not shoot projectiles, but rather summons "Anti Balloons" that go in reverse on the path.
Anti Ballons are retextured as bombs from minesweeper, and when they collide with a balloon, they will destroy itself and that balloon in one hit.

Notes:
- By default, one AntiBalloon gets created every second.
- The Hut tower which created these AntiBalloons costs $250
- Both the hut and balloon have their own custom texture
- When a tower is placed, the AntiBalloon will spawn on the nearest "Point," which are the points in the path where the path turns. A line is draw to show which tower is creating an AntiBalloon, and where it's being created.
- This is my first time using Processing, so the code isn't very clean.

Enjoy!
